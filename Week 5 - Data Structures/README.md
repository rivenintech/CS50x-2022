### [Inheritance](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/labs/5/)

Complete the implementation of `inheritance.c`, such that it creates a family of a specified generation size and assigns blood type alleles to each family member. The oldest generation will have alleles assigned randomly to them.

- The `create_family` function takes an integer (`generations`) as input and should allocate (as via `malloc`) one `person` for each member of the family of that number of generations, returning a pointer to the `person` in the youngest generation.
    - For example, `create_family(3)` should return a pointer to a person with two parents, where each parent also has two parents.
    - Each `person` should have `alleles` assigned to them. The oldest generation should have alleles randomly chosen (as by calling the `random_allele` function), and younger generations should inherit one allele (chosen at random) from each parent.
    - Each `person` should have `parents` assigned to them. The oldest generation should have both `parents` set to `NULL`, and younger generations should have `parents` be an array of two pointers, each pointing to a different parent.

We’ve divided the `create_family` function into a few `TODO`s for you to complete.

- First, you should allocate memory for a new person. Recall that you can use `malloc` to allocate memory, and `sizeof(person)` to get the number of bytes to allocate.
- Next, we’ve included a condition to check if `generations > 1`.
    - If `generations > 1`, then there are more generations that still need to be allocated. We’ve already created two new `parents`, `parent0` and `parent1`, by recursively calling `create_family`. Your `create_family` function should then set the parent pointers of the new person you created. Finally, assign both `alleles` for the new person by randomly choosing one allele from each parent.
    - Otherwise (if `generations == 1`), then there will be no parent data for this person. Both `parents` of your new person should be set to `NULL`, and each `allele` should be generated randomly.
- Finally, your function should return a pointer for the person that was allocated.

The `free_family` function should accept as input a pointer to a `person`, free memory for that person, and then recursively free memory for all of their ancestors.

- Since this is a recursive function, you should first handle the base case. If the input to the function is `NULL`, then there’s nothing to free, so your function can return immediately.
- Otherwise, you should recursively `free` both of the person’s parents before `free`ing the child.

## [Problem Set 5](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/5/)

### [Speller](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2022/psets/5/speller/)

Alright, the challenge now before you is to implement, in order, `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, and `unload` as efficiently as possible using a hash table in such a way that `TIME IN load`, `TIME IN check`, `TIME IN size`, and `TIME IN unload` are all minimized. To be sure, it’s not obvious what it even means to be minimized, inasmuch as these benchmarks will certainly vary as you feed `speller` different values for `dictionary` and for `text`. But therein lies the challenge, if not the fun, of this problem. This problem is your chance to design. Although we invite you to minimize space, your ultimate enemy is time. But before you dive in, some specifications from us.

- You may not alter `speller.c` or `Makefile`.
- You may alter `dictionary.c` (and, in fact, must in order to complete the implementations of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, and `unload`), but you may not alter the declarations (i.e., prototypes) of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, or `unload`. You may, though, add new functions and (local or global) variables to `dictionary.c`.
- You may change the value of `N` in `dictionary.c`, so that your hash table can have more buckets.
- You may alter `dictionary.h`, but you may not alter the declarations of `load`, `hash`, `size`, `check`, or `unload`.
- Your implementation of `check` must be case-insensitive. In other words, if `foo` is in dictionary, then `check` should return true given any capitalization thereof; none of foo, `foO`, `fOo`, `fOO`, `fOO`, `Foo`, `FoO`, `FOo`, and `FOO` should be considered misspelled.
- Capitalization aside, your implementation of `check` should only return `true` for words actually in `dictionary`. Beware hard-coding common words (e.g., `the`), lest we pass your implementation a `dictionary` without those same words. Moreover, the only possessives allowed are those actually in `dictionary`. In other words, even if `foo` is in `dictionary`, `check` should return `false` given `foo's` if `foo's` is not also in `dictionary`.
- You may assume that any `dictionary` passed to your program will be structured exactly like ours, alphabetically sorted from top to bottom with one word per line, each of which ends with `\n`. You may also assume that `dictionary` will contain at least one word, that no word will be longer than `LENGTH` (a constant defined in `dictionary.h`) characters, that no word will appear more than once, that each word will contain only lowercase alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes, and that no word will start with an apostrophe.
- You may assume that `check` will only be passed words that contain (uppercase or lowercase) alphabetical characters and possibly apostrophes.
- Your spell checker may only take `text` and, optionally, `dictionary` as input. Although you might be inclined (particularly if among those more comfortable) to “pre-process” our default dictionary in order to derive an “ideal hash function” for it, you may not save the output of any such pre-processing to disk in order to load it back into memory on subsequent runs of your spell checker in order to gain an advantage.
- Your spell checker must not leak any memory. Be sure to check for leaks with `valgrind`.
